<ul>
<li><strong>The Golden rule</strong><br>
We believe in treating others as we would like others to treat us.  This<br>
principle guides our everyday actions fostering respect, empathy and kindness<br>
with our customers, colleagues, and any other relationship or interaction.</li>
<li><strong>The Silver rule</strong><br>
We don’t do unto others what we would not want done to us. We work in an<br>
environment where we have good intent and not cause harm or discomfort to<br>
others.  We strive to create a considerate and safe environment where trust and<br>
collaboration can thrive.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong><br>
We believe in open and honest communication. By sharing information freely and<br>
clearly, we build trust, ensure accountability, and create a culture where<br>
everyone is informed, engaged, and empowered to contribute to our collective<br>
success.</li>
<li><strong>Humility</strong><br>
We recognize that we are part of a larger whole. We approach our work and<br>
relationships with a spirit of learning and growth, valuing the contributions<br>
and perspectives of others. By acknowledging our limitations and embracing<br>
continuous improvement, we cultivate a culture of mutual respect and shared<br>
progress.</li>
<li><strong>Resourcefulness</strong><br>
We emphasize finding effective ways to solve problems or achieve goals with<br>
the limited means available.</li>
