# Our values

* **The Golden rule**
    We believe in treating others as we would like others to treat us.  This
principle guides our everyday actions fostering respect, empathy and kindness
with our customers, colleagues, and any other relationship or interaction.
* **The Silver rule**
    We donâ€™t do unto others what we would not want done to us. We work in an
environment where we have good intent and not cause harm or discomfort to
others.  We strive to create a considerate and safe environment where trust and
collaboration can thrive.
* **Transparency**
    We believe in open and honest communication. By sharing information freely and
clearly, we build trust, ensure accountability, and create a culture where
everyone is informed, engaged, and empowered to contribute to our collective
success.
* **Humility**
    We recognize that we are part of a larger whole. We approach our work and
relationships with a spirit of learning and growth, valuing the contributions
and perspectives of others. By acknowledging our limitations and embracing
continuous improvement, we cultivate a culture of mutual respect and shared
progress.
* **Resourcefulness**
    We emphasize finding effective ways to solve problems or achieve goals with
the limited means available.
